This repo includes code to run analyses on Beta-diversity at the EU level.



Order of the scripts:



1. EVA\_in\_ecoregions: code to process EVA data;
2. Spat\_oper\_envlayers: code to process raster layers of climatic, topographic and anthropogenic drivers;
3. TopoClim\_for\_ecor: functions to extract climatic, topographic and anthropogenic for EVA data;
4. Drivers\_extraction: code to actually extract climatic, topographic and anthropogenic at each EVA location;
5. Match\_data\_ecor: code to perform statistical matching of ecoregion data between temporal periods.
